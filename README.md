# prometheus-operator-app chart

Giant Swarm offers a Prometheus Operator Managed App which can be installed in
workload clusters. Here we define the Prometheus chart with its templates and
default configuration.

## Requirements

In order to run this app requires the following to be installed:

* prometheus-operator-crd  0.x.x

## Good to know

The default configuration of this chart ignores secrets of type `helm.sh/release.v1`. This can be changed by changing the value of `prometheusOperator.secretFieldSelector` in your values.yaml. Example:

```
prometheusOperator:
  secretFieldSelector: ""
```
