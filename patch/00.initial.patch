 A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.

 ### From 10.x to 11.x
 
 Version 11 upgrades prometheus-operator from 0.42.x to 0.43.x. Starting with 0.43.x an additional `AlertmanagerConfigs` CRD is introduced. Helm does not automatically upgrade or install new CRDs on a chart upgrade, so you have to install the CRD manually before updating:

-    ## QueryLogFile specifies the file to which PromQL queries are logged. Note that this location must be writable,
-    ## and can be persisted using an attached volume. Alternatively, the location can be set to a stdout location such
-    ## as /dev/stdout to log querie information to the default Prometheus log stream. This is only available in versions
-    ## of Prometheus >= 2.16.0. For more details, see the Prometheus docs (https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/query-log/)

-    ## EnforcedSampleLimit defines global limit on number of scraped samples that will be accepted. This overrides any SampleLimit
-    ## set per ServiceMonitor or/and PodMonitor. It is meant to be used by admins to enforce the SampleLimit to keep overall
-    ## number of samples/series under the desired limit. Note that if SampleLimit is lower that value will be taken instead.
-    enforcedSampleLimit: false

-    ## AllowOverlappingBlocks enables vertical compaction and vertical query merge in Prometheus. This is still experimental
-    ## in Prometheus so it may change in any upcoming release.
